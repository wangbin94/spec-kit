# Lite Working Principles

1. **Ship focused value.** Every change must trace back to a user outcome stated in the current spec.
2. **Protect quality with fast tests.** Write or update the minimal failing tests that guard critical behavior before marking a feature complete.
3. **Keep artifacts lean.** Update only `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and docs that directly support this feature. Avoid creating extra documents unless essential.
4. **Communicate blockers.** Surface open questions or external dependencies immediately so they can be resolved before implementation stalls.

Review this agreement whenever priorities shift. Adjust the principles deliberately if the team needs a different balance between speed and rigor.
